            <p>For my class, I have to conduct research on a topic of my choice. I would like to understand how women who struggle with their periods manage it and locate resources. I decided on this topic because many women struggle with their menstrual cycles, and they don't always know what to do to manage it. Periods are something most women have to deal with for the majority of their lives, and so it is important that we take the time to really understand it.</p>
