Participants will include individuals who have used restaurant websites before, and exclude individuals who visit Chick-fil-A's website more than once a week.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> (3/3) Users assumed the spicy breakfast filet would appear under the breakfast tab, and were confused when it was not there.</p>
                    <p><strong>Initial Breakfast Page:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Breakfast Page after starting a pick-up order:</strong></p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="./images/break-pro.png" alt="Chick-fil-A's second breakfast page">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> Since the spicy breakfast filet is an actual menu item (as well as other filets), it is recommended that it be present on the initial home page of the site. Users should not have to start a pickup order in order to know that the item is offered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> (2/3) Users were already on the “Nutrition & Allergens” table, but exited out of the page and navigated to the “Waffle Potato Fries” page when they were tasked with determining if the Waffle Potato Fries are safe for a gluten allergy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem 3:</strong> (1/3) A participant noticed the “allergens” tab in the sidebar of the “Nutrition & Allergens” table and navigated to it, per the expected path, but once they did not see “gluten” explicitly listed as a table category, they navigate to the “Waffle Potato Fries” page to determine if the Waffle Potato Fries are safe for a gluten allergy, similarly to the other 2 participants.</p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="./images/allergen.png" alt="Chick-fil-A's nutrition & allergen table">
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="./images/allergen2.png" alt="Chick-fil-A's nutrition & allergen information under specific menu item">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> Make the “allergens” tab of the sidebar more apparent, and include all the nutrition and allergen information for each menu item on that menu item's designated page, so that users do not have to navigate to a completely different page to determine if an item meets their dietary preferences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Problem 4:</strong> (3/3) Users did not see a clear way to determine what all the vegan and vegetarian options are on the menu, so they went through each menu item to make the determination themselves.</p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="./images/dietary.png" alt="Chick-fil-A's hidden dietary preferences table">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> The “dietary preferences” page only exists if the user starts a pick up order, so it is recommended that you include this page on both versions of the site.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Problem 5:</strong> (3/3) Users were only able to determine that the Peppermint Chip Milkshake was available for a “limited time,” but they were unable to determine the exact dates of which the item is available. Each participant assumed the exact dates would be present on the Peppermint Chip Milkshake page.</p>
                    <img  class="thumbnail" src="./images/peppermint.png" alt="Chick-fil-A's peppermint chip milkshake page">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong>  Include the exact start and end date for the availability of the seasonal beverages on their designated page, so users know exactly when the items will no longer be available.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Problem 6:</strong> (1/3) A participant was met with a differently structured site after entering the “start a pickup order” page. This newly structured site had a different navigation structure, as well as missing elements that were once present, like the “search” option. Also, three key elements (that would have been useful for participants to complete tasks 2, 5, and 6) are missing from this differently structured page. The filets are present as a menu item, there is a “Dietary Preferences” page (that includes check box options like “vegetarian,” and “gluten sensitive), and the “catering” option is no longer present in the navigation, which caused P3 to not complete task 5 (while P1 and P2 completed it in less than 1 minute).</p>
                    <p><strong>Version 1 (initial home page):</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> Ensure that there is page setup consistency so that users are able to find what they are looking for regardless of what page they are on.</li>

                    <li>(1/3) Users felt the “Find Restaurant” button was too small, as they nearly missed it when trying to complete task 1.</li>
                    <li>(1/3) Users felt the labels in the nutrition & allergen table were too small. They also did not like that the labels were diagonal, meaning you have to tilt your head to read them. Lastly, they did not think having to scroll the right on the table to see all the categories was very intuitive.</li>
                    <li>(2/3) Users did not like that the nutrition and allergen information were located on a different page. (1/3) User said it is “annoying” that the information is located on a separate page.</li>
                    <li>(1/3) Users felt the order of the items in the sidebar of the nutrition & allergen table was confusing.</li>
                    <li>(1/3) User believed it would be easier to discover Chick-fil-A recipes if the link to the recipes page existed in the “explore all” page.</li>
                    <li>(1/3) Users believe the menu is easy to navigate if you are someone who is familiar with it, suggesting it is harder for newer users to navigate the menu successfully.</li>
                    <li>(1/3) User believes the website is easy to navigate, but thinks it could benefit from having better organization.</li>
